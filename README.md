# Naturalize
"From here, the world will be reborn."

Naturalize is a Python genetic algorithm solver for generic optimization problems.


If you have a input problem that , it can be solved with 
Given a input test functions, and a set of genes, it's possible for 

# 

Mutation
Crossover

# Example Basic
Finding the Optimal values to a mathematical function:

Our test funciton will just be the equation we wanted to solve.

We can encode the as a set of numbers

# 
Travelling salesman problem (Ex 2.)
Calibrating a siesmic damper (Ex 3.)
Optimizing member sizes in a truss (Ex 4.)
Topology optimziation for a truss structural system (Ex 5., Ex 6.)
Matching an image (Ex 7., Ex 8.)

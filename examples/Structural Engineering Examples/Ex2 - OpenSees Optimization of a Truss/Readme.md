Truss Optimizations
===================

The following examples optimize a several truss structure using the library "OpenSeesPy". Detailed information about OpenSees can be found at: https://openseespydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For convenience, the functions used to make each analysis are placed in the "trussAnalysis.py" file, and shared through each optimziation example.
An explanation on each function is given in that file, and not repeated.

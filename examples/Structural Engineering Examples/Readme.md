Structural Engineering Examples
===================

The following examples optimize a several truss structure using the library "OpenSeesPy". 
Detailed information about OpenSees can be found at: https://openseespydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For these examples it's assumed the user is already familiar with the basics of using OpenSeesPy and structural analysis.
Those not familiar with structural engineering concepts may find this difficult to follow!
